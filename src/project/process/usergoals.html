				<h2>User Goals</h2><br/>
				<h3>How will your users understand the content of the project?</h3>
				<p>They will be able to explore and filter information by time and/or location to find or discover event resources. </p><br/>
				<h3>How will your users understand the primary objectives?</h3>
				<p>Through simplified site navigation, ambiguity can be avoided by keeping all information specific and tailored to particulars rather than needing to provide a larger context. The basic structure of information available is what/when/where â€“ resources/schedule/map.</p><br/>
				<h3>What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it? </h3>
				<p>View information about particular events, discover available resources, and create a personal itinerary, through a database and cartographic interface.</p><br/>
				<h3>How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are their experience levels with the type of media you are creating? </h3>
				<p>The conference will attract a diverse audience and so accessibility standards are key to providing a useful interface to all. The interface and interaction loop will need to remain simple: find, filter, save, recall.</p><br/>

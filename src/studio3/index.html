						<p>This leatherman multitool has been one of my most useful assets. I never choose to leave the house without it. There are so many problems that are made small and easy to overcome with it, and even if it doesn’t get used every day there are other days where I could not have gotten by without it. It has worn its silhouette into all of my pants.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="face back">
					<p>Another long-time carry is a pen. I have used pilot g-2s since long ago in my days of illustration and still maintain boxes of them now. Again a thing that is not always used but does not always have an easy replacement.</p>

				<p>I acquired this wallet some years ago and quite enjoy it. It is designed to fit in pants front pockets and is made of very fine materials, maintaining a thin and easy to use profile.</p>

			<p>I cannot say that I like smart phones. They’re fragile, fickle, and can be responsible for health problems mental and physical. But their utility is much harder to question, having become nearly indispensable for some modern lifestyles. I have only owned two smart phones, an iPhone 4 and Galaxy S7; I do not believe that smartphone technology is evolving at the pace the media hypes it to be.</p>

		<div class="face back">
			<p>Most of the clothes I wear are blue so why not my watch too, it’s my favorite color anyways. I got this just recently and really appreciate its appearance but for some reason wish it had a subtle tick when I held it to my ear. I like to watch its motion in any case.</p>

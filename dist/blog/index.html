                <h2>Interface Review</h2><time datetime="2017-01-11">January 11, 2017</time>
                <p>Command line user interfaces have long been the core of computing technology, a relatively low level abstraction that is easy to develop for, but cannot directly guide a user experience as it is primarily user driven. It’s used for input,
                    or markup, to control some program that has been designed to recognize and respond to certain strings. This allows an experienced user of some program to quickly enter specific commands to perform some desired operation, but again
                    provides little direct guidance to those inexperienced.</p>

                <p>HTML/CSS is an interface to render things in a browser, typically composed as text markup by a user. The user directly types in the desired attributes with exact desired specifications and the program takes care of the rest. Now consider
                    a graphical user interface that allows the same level of input and control for the multitude of HTML/CSS attributes. There has not to my knowledge been a successful one.</p>

                <p>The UI designs I appreciate the most allow utilizing both methods – windows explorer for viewing or navigating files and the command line for performing options on them, big lists of emojis but also being able to directly type in the name
                    of a particular one, etc. It's a trade off of more upfront work for more immediate results later vs less effort and experience required for a visual experience; painting with words is hard.</p>

                <p>I have long resisted mobile tech because I do not enjoy the nearly universal visuals-only interfaces. I don’t like wading through subpages and menus and popups to get a program to do something that I’m already familiar with. I want instant
                    gratification and using the simplest methods possible usually makes that happen.</p>

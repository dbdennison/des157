                <h2>Topic Choice</h2>
                <p>I wish to explore archive methods for web content. I have personally collected thousands of documents from forums, blogs, and publications. This is done because, far from the ideal of “nothing on the internet is deleted,” resources, or
                    at least reasonable access to online resources, are highly volatile. Many research projects into niche areas have lead me to sites with dead links, censored, or 404ed content. Thus I make an effort to preserve the things that I believe
                    may ever be useful to me or others. I have collected many thousands of documents over a range of topics, mostly relating to programming, finances, and geography. I have also collected reference photography and source code for many
                    interesting things. As these are for personal use I don’t care about copyrights, but addressing that may be of interest for this project.</p>
                <p>Through this process I have developed methods of stripping unnecessary content from the source documents I preserve. Most personal websites are not designed with accessibility in mind, and as a result do not support clean print output.
                    Currently I use the “print to pdf” tool and custom print css for this. Many things can be generically disabled, but a great many sites require custom tooling to make them presentable and optimized for print.</p>
                <p>So then my idea is to make a public repository for print stylesheets, much like there are public repositories for blocking ads, and investigate providing a method for distributing it for use by others. This can also be expanded to more
                    generically cover accessibility, but that can easily become a slippery slope.</p>

            <h2>Geographic and Environmental data</h2>

            <p>Many repositories of federal geographic data are formatted as above. A brief description, technical specifications, and sometimes there may be a preview of the data or its coverage. Other repositories may lack such an interface at all and
                only be available via ftp with little or no documentation. The inconsistency of documentation and the differences in how the many involved agencies handle it make searches for particular data difficult on top of awareness of what could
                be available difficult to understand from the onset.</p>

            <h2>Public data archiving community</h2>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>With the new executive administration making efforts to censor scientific research, community efforts have risen to archive essential scientific data for preservation. Repositories and systems have been created to request and make verifiable
                archives of public data projects. The climatemirror organization utilizes a github issues forum to catalog and mark datasets that have been requested for archiving. Those with public storage space available have been working to create
                mirrors and ensure that they are available to others.</p>
            <p>This presents a new opportunity for creating a common interface into these datasets that could be very interesting to explore.</p>
            <h2>ESRI & AWS Landsat</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/landsat_esri.jpg">

            </figure>
            <p>Amazon has made an effort to archive the entirety of the landsat dataset, which has provided global-coverage spectral images of Earth on a 16 hour period since 1972. This data enables research into current environmental conditions around the
                world on a daily basis, and allows for comparisons to reference over time. Its wide spectrum sensors collect reflectance data which can be used to determine the nature of any visible surface feature.</p>
            <p>ESRI utilized the AWS repository to create a demo of this data. The menu bar on the left allows switching between different spectrums, such as vegetation, moisture, rock, visible light, and even agriculture in particular. Raw access to the
                full dataset allows the user to also input custom ranges of the spectrum to inspect. The user can click and drag around the map viewport, type the name of a place, and scrub through the dataâ€™s full time range.</p>
